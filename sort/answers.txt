sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: The time of this sort for the random50000.txt was the biggest, but what makes me sure that sort1 is a bubble sort is
                    the time test for the sorted10000.txt. In this test it got a better score than s3 and it make sense since the bubble sort
                        will compare pairs of values and will only go once through the list if it is sorted.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: In all the tests this sort had the best times.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: The times of this sort was in the middle compared with the other sorts and it had a bigger time than s1 when sorting sorted10000.txt.
                    This is because the sort had to compare each value in the list with the list.
