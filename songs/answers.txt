From the songs in songs.db, we can say that the person has an orange aura.
Orange is described as rebellious and bold. They share a need for high-energy, confidence-boosting sounds, and that's the type of energy rap music expresses.
While most of the songs are in the rap genre, that is not the only type of music on the list. We have songs about love, sadness, remixes for dancing, and a combination of other types.
Now if we look at the person again, we cannot say 100% that this person has an orange aura, and we do not know if this person just started listening to rap music.
While this type of calculation can give a general idea about a person, we need to remember that people do not fall into only one category.
My suggestion is that we can have the primary aura as the base of the person and then a secondary or even third shade of color to describe the different aspects of the person.
